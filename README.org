* quake-mode
  Minor mode providing Quake/Unreal-style killing sprees in Emacs.

  *Still very early in development, lots of bugs*

** Usage:
   Use
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
M-x: quake-mode
     #+END_SRC
   to toggle the mode on and off

** Fragging
   Currently the following functions count as a frag:
       #+BEGIN_SRC 
  (kill-word)
  (kill-comment)
  (kill-line)
  (kill-whole-line)
  (kill-rectangle)
  (kill-region)
  (kill-buffer)
     #+END_SRC
** Customization
*** Defining a frag
   You can enable other functions to count as frags like this:
       #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; kill-sexp will now count as a frag
  (quake/define-frag kill-sexp) 
     #+END_SRC
*** Behavior changes
    - quake/killing-spree-interval

      "The number of seconds that may pass between frags before your spree is reset.
    - quake/holy-shit-interval

      "The number of seconds before another holy shit can occur."
    - quake/fullscreen-holy-shit

      "If non-nil use the special fullscreen holy shit message."
** Sounds:
   COMING SOON
