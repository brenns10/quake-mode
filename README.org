* quake-mode
  Minor mode providing Quake/Unreal style killing spree counter for text killing in Emacs.

  *Still very early in development, things will probably be breaking often*
** Usage:
   Use
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
M-x: quake-mode
     #+END_SRC
   to toggle the mode on and off

** Fragging
   Currently the following functions count as frags:
       #+BEGIN_SRC 
  (kill-word)
  (kill-comment)
  (kill-line)
  (kill-whole-line)
  (kill-rectangle)
  (kill-region)
  (kill-buffer))
     #+END_SRC
** Customization
*** Defining a frag
   You can enable other functions to count as frags like this:
       #+BEGIN_SRC 
;; kill-sexp will now count as a frag
  (quake/define-frag kill-sexp) 
     #+END_SRC
*** Behavior changes
    - =quake/killing-spree-interval=
      "The number of seconds that may pass between kills part of the same spree."
    - =quake/holy-shit-interval=
      "The number of seconds before another holy shit can occur."
    - =quake/fullscreen-holy-shit=
      "If non-nil use the special fullscreen holy shit message."
** Sounds:
   COMING SOON
